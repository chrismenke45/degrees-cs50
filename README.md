This is the solution to the [six degrees of separation problem](https://vincentgranville.medium.com/graph-theory-six-degrees-of-separation-problem-1bc3cf1722a1). The bulk of the code is taken from [CS50's AI Degree project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/0/degrees/). My custom code is only in degrees.py on lines 96-155. [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)'s boiler plate allowed me to load in data to test the algorithm and show whether my algorithm worked.
